# Regression Models Using Statsmodels

`statsmodels` is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimator. The results are tested against existing statistical packages to ensure that they are correct. `statsmodels` supports specifying models using `R-style` formulas. For a complete introduction to the package visit their website (https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html).

Here I attempt to use it on pandas dataframe, build several models, and compare their goodness.
